           <section>
            <p>Thanks for looking! I'm David, and this is my travel blog. I'm an American who has been traveling the world full time for 8 years now.
    
                I first fell in love with travel on a solo road trip across Iceland in 2016. My budget was small, so I slept in the back of a rental car for 1 month while I drove 7,000 kilometers around the country, filming all of the scenic places in Iceland. One of my first videos racked up a few million views and was featured on international TV by BBC Travel. 
                
                Since then I've solo traveled to many developing countries, including almost every country in Asia, Central America, and the Middle East.
                
                I experienced the 7.0 Lombok earthquake in Indonesia in 2018, the bombings in Bangkok in 2019, and a fair share of scams, fights, sicknesses, car accidents, and other crazy things along the way.
                
                It hasn't always been easy, but over the years I've been blessed with some amazing experiences like sleeping in jungle treehouses in Bali, trekking to Mount Everest Base Camp in the Himalayas, going on Komodo dragon safaris in Indonesia, dining on tarantulas and scorpions in Cambodia, riding a camel to the Great Pyramids of Giza in Egypt

                This blog gets 350,000 monthly page views and growing. My goal is to create unique and fresh travel content and photos from around the world, with an emphasis on quality over quantity.
                
                I do all of the writing and photography on this website myself (no AI or stock images) unless otherwise noted. I'm also an FAA Part 107 trained and certified drone pilot for doing commercial work with drones in the United States.
                
                My past work has been featured by some big names in the travel industry, such as Travel + Leisure and BBC Travel, and my videos have racked up more than 20 million views on Facebook via companies like UNILAD Adventure and Must Do Travels.
                
                Over the years, I have also partnered with hotels, tourism bureaus.</p>
